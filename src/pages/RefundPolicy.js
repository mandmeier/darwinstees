                    <p>Since your order is custom printed just for you, we arenâ€™t responsible for refunds due to incorrect fit issues. Buyers assume all risks when choosing the style and fit of their purchase. To better help you in choosing the right size, we have made available a Size Chart.

                    <h3>Order Modifications or Cancellation</h3>
                    <p>After your order has been placed, you have 24 hours to contact our customer service team, and request order modifications or a cancellation. After 24 hours, your order has already been placed in production and can no longer be modified.</p>

                    <p>At Darwin's Tees, we are doing our best to ensure product quality and order accuracy.

                    <p>All we need is your order number and a clear photo showing either the incorrect item, the poor quality of the print or the damaged area of the item. Please contact us by email at <b>support@darwinstees.com</b> and we will organise a reprint or a refund for you!</p>
                    <h3>Order not received</h3>
                    <p>If your item has not arrived within 30 days after having ordered, contact one of our heroes through our contact us page for a free replacement order or a full refund of your purchase.
